**Real-Time-Weather-Intelligence-System-with-Microsoft-Fabric-and-Azure**

üìò Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time weather monitoring and alerting system using a modern data engineering stack. By integrating Weather APIs, Azure Databricks, Azure Functions, Event Hubs, Microsoft Fabric, Kusto DB, and Power BI, we enable real-time data streaming, processing, visualization, and alerts.

## üìì Notebook Setup (Weather API Ingestion)

1. **Create a Development Environment**  
   - on fabric notebook.

2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   - `requests`, `pyspark`, and Azure Event Hub connector (`azure-eventhubs-spark`)

3. **Configure Azure Key Vault Integration**  
   - Use secret scopes or environment variables to access the Weather API key securely.

4. **Test API Access in Notebook**  
   - Use Python and `requests` to call the Weather API and verify the response.

5. **Parse Weather API Response**  
   - Extract and transform JSON data into structured format using PySpark DataFrames.

6. **Send Data to Azure Event Hub**  
   - Use the Event Hub Spark connector to stream structured weather data in real-time.

7. **Schedule Notebook Jobs (Optional)**  
   - Set up automated runs for continuous or scheduled ingestion.



  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Azure Function Setup (Weather API Ingestion)

1. **Create Function App** in Azure with Python runtime.  
2. **Add Timer Trigger** to call Weather API at regular intervals 30sec.  
3. **Store API Key in Azure Key Vault** and access it securely via Managed Identity.  
4. **Write Code** to fetch weather data using `requests` and transform as needed.  
5. **Send Data to Event Hub** using the Azure Event Hub SDK.
